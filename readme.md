Our unit tests and code coverage reports can be run and viewed by running the `coverage_jsunit_gen.sh`. This will generate a folder named `instrumented`. The tests can be run by launching `instrumented/jsunit/testRunner.html`. This will bring up the test page. Next, load in the test file `instrumended/jstests.html` and run jsunit. After the tests have completed, the coverage report can be viewed.
