Please see `user_manual.pdf` for instructions on how to set up the server environment.

Our unit tests and code coverage reports can be run and viewed by running the `coverage_jsunit_gen.sh`. This will generate a folder named `instrumented`. The tests can be run by launching `instrumented/jsunit/testRunner.html`. This will bring up the test page. Next, load in the test file `instrumended/jstests.html` and run jsunit. After the tests have completed, the coverage report can be viewed.

If you are not on a unix platform with jscoverage installed, please see the screenshots below for our test coverage. The most recent tests are also available at http://picon.case.edu/chess/instrumented/jsunit/testRunner.html. run the file `picon.case.edu/chess/instrumended/jstests.html` (as seen below).
